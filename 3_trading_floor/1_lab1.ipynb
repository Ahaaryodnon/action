I asked o3 with Deep Research to try to find workarounds; it <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/share/6817bbc3-3d0c-8012-9b51-631842470628\">confirmed the issue</a> and confirmed the workaround.<br/><br/>\n",
    "            The workaround is a bit of a bore. It is to take advantage of \"WSL\", the Microsoft approach for running Linux on your PC. You'll need to carry out more setup instructions! But it's quick, and several students have confirmed that this works perfectly for them, then the Week 6 MCP labs work. Plus, WSL is actually a great way to build software on your Windows PC.<br/>\n",
    "            The WSL Setup instructions are in the Setup folder, <a href=\"../setup/SETUP-WSL.md\">in the file called SETUP-WSL.md here</a>. I do hope this only holds you up briefly - you should be back up and running quickly. Oh the joys of working with bleeding-edge technology!<br/><br/>\n",

Each file's content is returned with its path as a reference. Failed reads for individual files won't stop the entire operation. Only works within allowed directories.\n",

Files have no children array, while directories always have a children array (which may be empty). The output is formatted with 2-space indentation for readability. Only works within allowed directories.\n",
      "move_file: Move or rename files and directories. Can move files between directories and rename them in a single operation. If the destination exists, the operation will fail. Works across different directories and can be used for simple renaming within the same directory. Both source and destination must be within allowed directories.\n",
      "search_files: Recursively search for files and directories matching a pattern. Searches through all subdirectories from the starting path. The search is case-insensitive and matches partial names. Returns full paths to all matching items. Great for finding files when you don't know their exact location. Only searches within allowed directories.\n",

This tool is perfect for understanding file characteristics without reading the actual content. Only works within allowed directories.\n",
