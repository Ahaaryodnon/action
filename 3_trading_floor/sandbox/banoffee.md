# Banoffee Pie Recipe

## Ingredients
- Butter
- Flour
- Egg yolk
- Sugar
- Cold water
- Baking beans or uncooked rice
- Caramel (store-bought or homemade)
- Bananas (sliced)
- Whipping cream
- Dark chocolate (for garnish)

## Method

### Step 1: Make the Pastry Case
1. Put the butter and flour in a food processor and pulse until it resembles fresh breadcrumbs.
2. Add the egg yolk and sugar, then pulse again. Gradually add cold water until the dough comes together.

### Step 2: Chill the Dough
1. Knead the dough into a smooth ball, wrap in cling film, and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.

### Step 3: Bake the Pastry Case
1. Preheat oven to 190C/170C/gas 4 and grease a 23cm loose-bottomed tart tin.
2. Roll out chilled pastry to line the tin, leaving about half a cm above the edge.
3. Line with baking parchment and weigh down with beans or rice. Bake for 15 minutes, then remove the weight and brush with egg white. Bake for another 15-20 minutes until golden. Cool completely.

### Step 4: Assemble the Pie
1. Spread half of the caramel on the cooled pastry case, layer sliced bananas, and top with the remaining caramel. Chill in the fridge.

### Step 5: Add Cream and Garnish
1. Whip cream until thick and spoon over the tart. Garnish with finely grated dark chocolate.
