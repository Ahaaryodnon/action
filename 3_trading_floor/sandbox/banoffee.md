## Difficulty
Easy

## Prep Time
30 mins

## Cook Time
30 mins + 35 mins chilling

## Ingredients
### For the pastry:
- 100g chilled butter (plus extra for greasing)
- 200g plain flour
- 1 medium egg (separated)
- 1 tbsp golden caster sugar

### For the filling:
- 4 sliced bananas
- 394g caramel or dulce de leche
- 300ml double cream
- Dark chocolate (optional, for garnish)

## Method
1. **Make the Pastry Case:**  
   In a food processor, pulse the butter and flour until resembling breadcrumbs. Add the egg yolk and sugar, then cold water until the dough comes together. Knead gently and chill for 30 mins.

2. **Preheat Oven:**  
   Heat oven to 190C/170C fan.

3. **Line the Tart Tin:**  
   Roll out pastry, line a greased 23cm tart tin, and snip excess pastry. Line with baking parchment and weights, bake for 15 mins, then brush with egg white and bake for another 15-20 mins.

4. **Cool Pastry:**  
   Let it cool completely.

5. **Add Filling:**  
   Spread half of the caramel in the pastry case, layer the banana slices, then add the remaining caramel. Chill.

6. **Whip Cream:**  
   Whip the cream until thick and spoon it over the tart. Garnish with grated dark chocolate if desired.

## Notes
- The pastry case can be made a day in advance.  
- Best served fresh, but it can be kept in the fridge overnight.
