# Banoffee Pie Recipe

## Ingredients
- **For the pastry:**  
  - Butter  
  - Flour  
  - Egg yolk  
  - Sugar  
  - Very cold water  

- **For the filling:**  
  - Caramel (half for the base, half for layering)  
  - Bananas (sliced)  
  - Whipped cream  
  - Dark chocolate (for garnish)  

## Method
1. **Make the pastry case:**  
   - In a food processor, pulse butter and flour until it resembles fresh breadcrumbs.  
   - Add egg yolk and sugar, then pulse again. Gradually add very cold water until it forms a ball of dough.  
   - Knead gently then wrap in cling film and chill in the fridge for 30 mins.

2. **Prepare for baking:**  
   - Preheat the oven to 190C/170C/gas 4. Grease a 23cm loose-bottomed tart tin.  
   - Roll out the pastry and line the tin, snipping excess pastry edge.  
   - Line with baking parchment and weigh down with baking beans. Bake for 15 mins, then remove the paper and beans, brush with egg white, and bake for an additional 15-20 mins until golden. Cool completely.

3. **Assemble the pie:**  
   - Spread half of the caramel on the cooled pastry case and layer sliced bananas on top.  
   - Cover with the remaining caramel and chill in the fridge.

4. **Finish off:**  
   - Whip the cream until thick and spoon over the tart.  
   - Garnish with finely grated dark chocolate before serving.
